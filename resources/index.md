# Detailed schedule and resources


## Class 3

* Make sure that you have Show File Extensions turned on in your
  operating system. For example, you must be able to see the `.py` at
  the end of your Python files, when browsing folders.
* When opening a Python file, do not just double-click on it in the
  folder view. First open the IDLE application, then use the Open
  command in the File menu.
  
Today we review the concepts in the assigned reading, including script mode, order of operations, string operations, comments, function calls, and math functions.




## Class 2

We will review the concepts in the assigned reading, then look ahead
to some things needed in the afternoon lab: commenting out code; the
distinction between executing code via the console and running Python
scripts.

Here are a couple of clarifications of the assigned reading material:
* In this course, we use Python 3 (not Python 2), the same as
  recommended by the textbook.
* For running Python in a web browser, the textbook author recommends
  [pythonanywhere.com](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/). Another good
  option is [replit.com](https://replit.com), which we played around
  with in the last class meeting.
* *However*, in this course we will mostly be learning to write
  programs using files on our own computer and running Python on our
  own computer (not in the cloud inside a web browser). For this, you
  should use the IDLE editor. This comes bundled with a standard
  Python download, which is available at
  [python.org](https://www.python.org/)

Pair programming will be discussed if we have time, otherwise we can
talk about it in lab. Key ideas:
* There are two roles, *driver* and *navigator*. The driver uses the
  keyboard and mouse to write and run code, whereas the navigator
  assists by making suggestions.
* You must switch roles at least every 30 minutes.


## Class 1

* We will play around a little on [replit.com](https://replit.com),
  but this will mostly be an informal introduction to the course.
* Please read the syllabus carefully and bring any questions to the
  next class.
* Note the required reading: complete this before the next class.
* Note when the first homework assignment is due. 
* Finally, don't forget we have a lab on Wednesday at 3 PM.
