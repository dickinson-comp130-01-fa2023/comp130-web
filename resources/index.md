# Detailed schedule and resources

## Class 1

* We will play around a little on [replit.com](https://replit.com),
  but this will mostly be an informal introduction to the course.
* Please read the syllabus carefully and bring any questions to the
  next class.
* Note the required reading: complete this before the next class.
* Note when the first homework assignment is due. 
* Finally, don't forget we have a lab on Wednesday at 3 PM.
