# Detailed schedule and resources

## Class 1

* We will play around a little on [replit.com](https://replit.com),
  but this will mostly be an informal introduction to the course.
* Please read the syllabus carefully and bring any questions to the
  next class.
* Note the required reading: complete this before the next class.
* Note when the first homework assignment is due. 
* Finally, don't forget we have a lab on Wednesday at 3 PM.


## Class 2



We will review the concepts in the assigned reading, then look ahead
to some things needed in the afternoon lab: commenting out code; the
distinction between executing code via the console and running Python
scripts.

Here are a couple of clarifications of the assigned reading material:
* In this course, we use Python 3 (not Python 2), the same as
  recommended by the textbook.
* For running Python in a web browser, the textbook author recommends
  [pythonanywhere.com](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/). Another good
  option is [replit.com](https://replit.com), which we played around
  with in the last class meeting.
* *However*, in this course we will mostly be learning to write
  programs using files on our own computer and running Python on our
  own computer (not in the cloud inside a web browser). For this, you
  should use the IDLE editor. This comes bundled with a standard
  Python download, which is available at
  [python.org](https://www.python.org/)

Pair programming will be discussed if we have time, otherwise we can
talk about it in lab.
