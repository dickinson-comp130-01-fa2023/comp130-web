## Written exam 1

The exam covers topics 1-5 and Social/Ethical I and II. Most questions
will be similar to examples from the homework, textbook, or
lectures. The best way to prepare for the exam is to ensure that (i)
you understand all material in assigned sections of the textbook and
assigned sections of the supplementary study guide; and (ii) you can
complete all homework questions without help.

The exam is "closed book," meaning that you may not consult any
printed, written, electronic, or other materials. Exception: you may
bring into the exam one page of handwritten notes (one side of US
letter sized paper only).

You may not use electronic devices during the exam. Answers must be
written on paper using pen or pencil.

The duration of the exam is 50 minutes, and there will be questions
worth a total of 50 points on the exam. So you should budget your time
at the rate of about one point per minute.  Try to allocate your time
wisely: spend only about 10 minutes on a 10-point question, and about
5 minutes on a 5-point question, and so on.
